## Status

![example workflow](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/test_on_push.yml/badge.svg)

## Motivation

This repository holds a project called [`ConsumeIT`](https://consume-it.vercel.app/). In this project, I created an online distribution platform.

Users can chose from a given range of products provided by a (rather unreliable) source.

They can purchase them after applying discount codes and checking availability.

You can run it by cloning the repository. Running `cd consumeIT`,`yarn install` then executing the command `yarn dev`.

## Requirements

Typescript, React, Next.js, Jest and more.
